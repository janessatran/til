# HTML Key Concepts

*Document type declaration:*
- the document type declaration `<!DOCTYPE html> is required as the first line of an HTML document
- doctype declaration is an instruction to the browser about what type of document to expect and which version of HTML is being used

*HTML element:*
- the `<html>` element, the root of an HTML document, should be added after the doctype declaration 
- all content/structure for an HTML document should be contained between the opening and closing `<html>` tags
