## Energy Efficiency Notes

## Net to Gross
- **Gross Savings**: estimated by engineers who compare 2 things: (1) standard or replaced equiprement to (2) requipment installed through an energy effiency program.
- **Adjusted Gross Savings**:account for factors such as data errors, installation rates, persistence rates, and hours of use
- **Net Savings**: primarily account for the effects of free riders and spillover
- **Spillover**: represents savings caused by the presence of an energy efficiency program, but customers do not receive incentives or technical assistance from the program
- **Free riders**: participants who would have implemented the measure in the absense of the program

*Net to Gross Ratio* = 1 - Free Ridership + Spillover

## Why does NTG Matter?
- NTG helps identify effectiveness / success of programs that encourages greater innovation for energy efficiency resources
