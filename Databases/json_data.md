## JSON Data

- alternative to relation model that is appropriate for semi-structured data
- stands for JavaScript Object Notation 
- standard for "serializing" data objects, usually in files 
- human-readable, useful for data interchange 

### Basic constructs (recursive)
- **base values**: number, string, boolean
- **objects**: sets of label-value pairs; enclosed in curly brackets {}
- **arrays**: lists of values; enclosed in straight brackets []

### Relational Model vs JSON

|                 | Relational   | JSON  | 
|-----------------|--------------|------------|
| Structure       | Tables  | Nested Sets, Arrays  | 
| Schema          | Fixed in advance  | "self-describing" flexible |  
| Queries         | Simple expressive languages  | widely used  |   
| Ordering        | None  | Arrays  |   
| Implementation  | Native systems  | Coupled with Programming Languages. NoSQL Systems  |
