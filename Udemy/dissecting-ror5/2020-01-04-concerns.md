## Concerns

**Concerns** are a tool provided by the `ActiveSupport` lib that allows you create a module that you can include in other classes. *Note, there are mixed feelings about whether or not concerns make things more complicated than necessary... *

For example, we can create a module that creates a placeholder image with a given `width` and `height`. This is a good candidate for a concern because we re-use this image-generating URL throughout our application and since it's a relatively not-simple string we re-use, it's prone to creating bugs from typos.

```ruby
# app/models/concerns/placeholder.rb

module Placeholder
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern

  def self.image_generator(height:, width:)
    "http://placehold.it/#{height}x#{width}"
  end
end

```

Now that we've created this concern, we can include it in our model classes to generate placeholder images before intiailization. 

```ruby
# app/models/skills.rb

class Skill < ApplicationRecord
  include Placeholder
  validates_presence_of :title, :percent_utilized

  after_initialize :set_defaults

  def set_defaults
    self.badge ||= Placeholder.image_generator(height: '250', width: '250')
  end
end

```

### Keyword arguments
Ruby 2.0 supports keyword arguments through defining method arguments with colons. This enables us to call the method with a key-value pair. 

```ruby
def greet(name:)
  puts "Hello, #{name}"
end

greet(name: "Lloyd") # => "Hello, Lloyd"
```
