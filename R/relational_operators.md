## Relational Operators
- equality of types is checked by ```== ```
- inequality of types is checked by ```!=```
- ```> and <``` used to check greater than and less than
  - for strings, will use alphabetical order to check condition
- ```>= and <=``` used to check greater than or equal to, less than or equal to
- can compare vectors using relational operators
  - compares across every element in vector and returns TRUE or FALSE
  
Things to keep in mind:
- R is case sensitive so ```"useR" == "user"``` is ```FALSE```
- ```TRUE``` equates to 1 and ```FALSE``` equates to 0
