## Supervised Learning in R


#### Random Notes:
`%>%`:
- passes the left hand side of the opeartor to the first argument of the right hand side of the operator
- Often `%>%` is called multiple times to chain functions together (accomplishes same result as nesting)
- for example, `iris %>% head()` is equivalent to  `head(iris)`

`select()`: keeps only the variables you mention
`rename()`: keeps all variables
